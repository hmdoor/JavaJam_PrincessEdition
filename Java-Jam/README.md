# Java Jam, the ultimate princess battle!

Java Jam is a program I modified to get more experience with examples of Polymorphism and Inheritance in a fun little program that lets you model epic battles between two Disney princess and their magical weapons.

You can make new fighters by implementing the Fightable interface or extending one of the existing fighting classes. Create fighters that are vulnerable to different kinds of weapons. Make fighters that are small and quick, can heal or hit point sacks of hard hitting power.

You can make a new weapon by implementing the Strikable interface or extending one of the weapon classes. Create magical weapons that deal ice, fire, bashing or magic damage. Create hard hitting weapons that need time to recharge or quick weapons that, while not dealing much damage per strike, can deal more than one strike per round.
